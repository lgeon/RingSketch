In our implementation, packets received by OvS are placed in a ring buffer before being forwarded. The user_reader program will read the contents of the ring buffer and inserts them into Sketch.The implementation of OvS is based on OvS-2.16.0 and dpdk-20.11.6. Use netdev-dpif.c to replace the file with the same name in the ovs-2.16.0/lib/ folder, and then recompile and install ovs. In the DPDK_Implementation folder, execute the make command to compile the user_reader program, and then directly execute the user_reader program.
